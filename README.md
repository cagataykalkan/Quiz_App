# Quiz_App
## Basic MVC quiz app with swift using firebase and open trivia DB api 

To connect the project to the API 
=============
- you need to obtain your own API key. 
- You can do this by visiting "https://opentdb.com/api_token.php?command=request" to get your token. 
- Once you have your token, you can use it in the "https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&token=YOURTOKENHERE" URL. 
- Paste your token into the `urlString` part of the QuizVC.swift file to use it.
