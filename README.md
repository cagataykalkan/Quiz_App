# Quiz_App
 basic MVC quiz app with swift using firebase and open trivia DB api 

To connect the project to the API, you need to obtain your own API key. You can do this by visiting "https://opentdb.com/api_token.php?command=request" to get your token. Once you have your token, you can use it in the "https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&token=YOURTOKENHERE" URL. Paste your token into the `urlString` part of the QuizVC.swift file to use it.
